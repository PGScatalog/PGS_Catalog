  title: PGS Catalog REST API
  version: '1.8.6'
  description: |
    Programmatic access to the PGS Catalog metadata. More information about the metadata and its structure can be found [here](/docs/).

    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle pgs_color_1"></i> Each PGS is provided as a scoring file (containing the variants, alleles, effect weights) on our <a href="http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/spot/pgs/scores/" target="_blank">FTP site</a>.
    The variants are not distributed within this API; however, a link to the scoring file is provided in the<code>ftp_scoring_file</code>field for each result of the<code>/rest/score/</code>endpoints for ease of download.

    ###### REST API settings

    * `pagination`: This REST API is using pagination for the endpoints returning more than 1 results. It is currently set to **50** results per page.
      <a class="toggle_btn pgs_btn_plus" id="pagination">More information</a>
      <div class="toggle_content" id="content_pagination" style="display:none">

        ###### **Pagination structure**

        Here is an example of the pagination result structure in JSON:

        ```
          {
            "size": 50,
            "count": 137,
            "next": "https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/score/all?limit=50&offset=50",
            "previous": null,
            "results": [
              < list the results 1 to 50 >
            ]
          }
        ```
        * **size**: is the number of results in the current page.
        * **count**: is the overall number of results.
        * **next**: is the URL to the following page of results.
        * **previous**: is the URL to the preceding page of results (only present if you are not on the first page).
        * **results**: contains the list of results of the current page.
        <pre></pre>
        ###### **Pagination parameters**
        * **limit**: The number of results per page can be overwritten using this parameter, e.g:
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?limit=100</code>: returns the first 100 results.
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?limit=150</code>: returns all the results (the overall number of results is 137 in our example above).

          The default value is **50**. The maximum value is **250**. Over this maximum value, the REST API returns an error 400.

        * **offset**: This parameter indicates the starting position (0 based) of the query in relation to the complete set of results. It provides access to a desired range of results, e.g.:
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?offset=75</code> provides results from the number **76** to **125**, as the number of results per page is **50** by default (equivalent to "limit=50")
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?offset=75&limit=60</code> provides results from the number **76** to **135**

      </div>


    * `rate limit`: The limit number of queries is set to **100** queries per minute.
      <a class="toggle_btn pgs_btn_plus" id="rate_limit">More information</a>
      <div class="toggle_content" id="content_rate_limit" style="display:none">
        Here is an example of the JSON message returned if the rate limit is reached:

        ```
          {
            "message": "request limit exceeded",
            "availableIn": "33 seconds"
          }
        ```
        * **message**: description of the error.
        * **availableIn**: number of seconds before the rate limit is reset.
      </div>

        ###### **Filtering**

        You can choose to filter the results of this endpoint to a specified list of polygenic scores by providing a list of PGS IDs in one of two ways:
        1. A comma-seperated list of scores in the request URL (this will not work for larger queries), e.g.:

        https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/score/all?filter_ids=PGS000001,PGS000002
        ```
        2. A json-formatted list of IDs, e.g.: `{ "filter_ids" : ["PGS000001","PGS000002"] }`. Example with curl:
        ```
        curl -X GET 'https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/score/all' -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{ "filter_ids" : ["PGS000001", "PGS000002"] }'
