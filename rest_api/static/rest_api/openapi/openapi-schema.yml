    ###### REST API settings

    * `pagination`: This REST API is using pagination for the endpoints returning more than 1 results. It is currently set to **50** results per page.
      <a class="toggle_btn" id="pagination">More information <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></a>
      <div class="toggle_content" id="content_pagination" style="display:none">

        ###### **Pagination structure**

        Here is an example of the pagination result structure in JSON:

        ```
          {
            "size": 50,
            "count": 137,
            "next": "https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/score/all?limit=50&offset=50",
            "previous": null,
            "results": [
              < list the results 1 to 50 >
            ]
          }
        ```
        * **size**: is the number of results in the current page.
        * **count**: is the overall number of results.
        * **next**: is the URL to the following page of results.
        * **previous**: is the URL to the preceding page of results (only present if you are not on the first page).
        * **results**: contains the list of results of the current page.
        <pre></pre>
        ###### **Pagination parameters**
        * **limit**: The number of results per page can be overwritten using this parameter, e.g:
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?limit=100</code>: returns the first 100 results.
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?limit=150</code>: returns all the results (the overall number of results is 137 in our example above).

          The default value is **50**. The maximum value is **250**. Over this maximum value, the REST API returns an error 400.

        * **offset**: This parameter indicates the starting position (0 based) of the query in relation to the complete set of results. It provides access to a desired range of results, e.g.:
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?offset=75</code> provides results from the number **76** to **125**, as the number of results per page is **50** by default (equivalent to "limit=50")
          * <code>.../rest/score/all/?offset=75&limit=60</code> provides results from the number **76** to **135**

      </div>


    * `rate limit`: The limit number of queries is set to **100** queries per minute.
      <a class="toggle_btn" id="rate_limit">More information <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></a>
      <div class="toggle_content" id="content_rate_limit" style="display:none">
        Here is an example of the JSON message returned if the rate limit is reached:

        ```
          {
            "message": "request limit exceeded",
            "availableIn": "33 seconds"
          }
        ```
        * **message**: description of the error.
        * **availableIn**: number of seconds before the rate limit is reset.
      </div>

    <div class="toggle_content" id="content_changelog" style="display:none">

      * <span class="badge badge-pill badge-pgs">1.6</span> - March 2021:
        * New endpoint `/rest/info` with data such as the REST API version, latest release date and counts, PGS citation, ...
        * New endpoint `/rest/cohort/all` returning all the Cohorts and their associated PGS.
        * New endpoint `/rest/sample_set/all` returning all the Sample Set data.

      * <span class="badge badge-pill badge-pgs">1.5</span> - February 2021:
        * Split the array of the field **associated_pgs_ids** (from the `/rest/publication/` endpoint) in 2 arrays **development** and **evaluation**, e.g.:
          ```
            "associated_pgs_ids": {
              "development": [
                  "PGS000011"
              ],
              "evaluation": [
                  "PGS000010",
                  "PGS000011"
              ]
            }
          ```

        * New flag parameter **include_parents** for the endpoint `/rest/trait/all` to display the traits in the catalog + their parent traits (default: 0)

      * <span class="badge badge-pill badge-pgs">1.4</span> - January 2021:
        * Setup a maximum value for the `limit` parameter.
        * Add a new field **size** at the top of the paginated results, to indicate the number of results visible in the page.
        * Replace the fields **labels** and **value** under performance_metrics**&rarr;**effect_sizes**/**class_acc**/**othermetrics in the `/rest/performance` endpoints by new fields: **name_long**, **name_short**, **estimate**, **ci_lower**, **ci_upper** and **se**.

          Now the content of the **labels** and **value** fields are structured like this, e.g.:
          ```
            {
              "name_long": "Odds Ratio",
              "name_short": "OR",
              "estimate": 1.54,
              "ci_lower": 1.51,
              "ci_upper": 1.57,
              "se": 0.0663
            }
          ```
        * Restructure the **samples**&rarr;**sample_age**/**followup_time** JSON (used in several endpoints):
          * Merge and replace the fields **mean** and **median** into generic fields **estimate_type** and **estimate**:
            ```
              "estimate_type": "mean",
              "estimate": 53.0
            ```
          * Merge and replace the fields **se** and **sd** into generic fields **variability_type** and **variability**:
            ```
              "variability_type": "sd",
              "variability": 16.0,
            ```
          * Merge and replace the fields **range** and **iqr** by a new structure **interval**:
            ```
              "interval": {
                "type": "range",
                "lower": 51.0,
                "upper": 77.0
              }
            ```
            Note: The field **type** can take the value 'range', 'iqr' or 'ci'.
