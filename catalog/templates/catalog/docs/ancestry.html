      Essential to the interpretation of PGS data is the accurate description of the ancestry of samples included in these studies. The PGS Catalog describes the ancestry of samples, in a standardized manner, according to the <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1396-2">published framework</a> developed by the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ancestry">NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog</a> and endorsed in the recent <a href="https://rdcu.be/ciBFz">Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standards (PRS-RS)</a>. Sample ancestry is represented in two forms: (1) an ancestry category from a controlled list and (2) a more detailed ancestry name/description (if available). Detailed descriptions aim to capture accurate, informative, and comprehensive information regarding the ancestry or genealogy of each distinct sample. Category assignment reduces complexity within data sets and enables the establishment of hierarchical relationships, placing samples in context with other samples, groups, and populations.

      <h3 id="anc_category">Ancestry Categories</h3>
      <p>
        Each sample description is mapped to an ancestry category and the samples are combined if they belong to the same category. We attempt to report ancestry-specific sample descriptions (e.g. sample sizes and case/control breakdowns); however, this is not always possible and samples can be labelled with more than one broad ancestry category.<br/>
        A complete list of ancestry categories used in the PGS Catalog (adapted from <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1396-2/tables/1">Table 1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1396-2">Morales et al 2018</a>) can be found below:

                The calculation of the ancestry distribution for samples used in PGS Evaluation is different from those in development, to highlight the diversity of ancestries represented in this stage instead of their relative sample sizes. To calculate the ancestry distribution for PGS Evaluation we first assign an ancestry label to each unique Sample Set the PGS has been applied to. Samples are labelled Multi-ancestry (including or excluding Europeans) if more than one ancestry is present in the combined Sample Set (<i>see example</i>).
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                The distribution is calculated by dividing the number of Sample Sets with the same ancestry category by the total number of Sample Sets. This can be interpreted as the percentage of a scores’ performance data that is derived from a specific ancestry group; however, it should be noted that the percentage does not account for sample size differences between the sample sets for simplicity.

      <h3 id="anc_filter">Filtering PGS by Ancestry</h3>

      <p>
        Users may be interested in finding PGS that have been developed or evaluated with data from a particular ancestry group. To facilitate this we’ve implemented filters on the PGS browsing, Publication and Trait pages that show/hide scores based on the ancestry data and criteria you select. With this comes two display options that easily allow users to identify PGS using multi-ancestry data or scores that are ‘non-European’ (e.g. contain no European ancestry data).<br/>
        The data can be filtered with two selections: (1) selecting the stage of the PGS study design you’re interested in querying, (2) selecting the ancestry category you are interested in viewing data for.
