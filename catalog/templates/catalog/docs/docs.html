        <p>Each publication in the database is given a <u>Polygenic Publication (<b>PGP</b>) ID</u> so that scores and evaluations link to the same source object.
        When browsing by publications the <u>Number of PGS Developed</u> refers to the number of newly developed PGS in the paper, and the <u>Number of PGS Evaluated</u>
        refers to the number of PGS (new and existing) that have performance metrics derived in the study. For each publication the following information is extracted:</p>
