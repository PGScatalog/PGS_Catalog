      <h3 id="score">What is a Polygenic Score?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>A polygenic score (PGS)</b> aggregates the effects of many genetic variants into a single number which predicts genetic predisposition for a phenotype.
            <b>PGS</b> are typically composed of hundreds-to-millions of genetic variants (usually <span title="SNPs" data-content="Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms" class="pgs_helpover">SNPs</span>) which are combined using a weighted sum of allele dosages multiplied by their corresponding effect sizes, as estimated from a relevant genome-wide association study (<span title="GWAS" data-content="Genome-wide association studies" class="pgs_helpover">GWAS</span>).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>PGS</b> nomenclature is heterogeneous: they can also be referred to as <b>genetic scores</b> or <b>genomic scores</b>, and as <b>polygenic risk scores (PRS)</b> or <b>genomic risk scores (GRS)</b> if they predict a discrete phenotype, such as a disease.
        </p>

      <h3 id="project">The PGS Catalog Project</h3>
        <p>
            The <span title="Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog" class="pgs_helptip"><b>PGS Catalog</b></span> is an open database of published <b>polygenic scores (PGS)</b>.
            Each <b>PGS</b> in the <b>Catalog</b> is consistently annotated with relevant metadata; including scoring files (variants, effect alleles/weights), annotations of how the PGS was developed and applied, and evaluations of their predictive performance.
            See the <a href="/docs/">PGS Catalog Data Description</a> page for a complete description of the metadata captured for PGS, Samples, Performance Metrics, Traits, and Publications.

      <h3 id="eligibility">PGS Catalog Inclusion Criteria</h3>
      <p>For a publication's data to be included in the PGS Catalog it must contain one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A newly developed PGS.</b> This includes the following information about the score and its predictive ability (<u>evaluated on samples not used to develop the score</u>):
          <ul>
            <li>Variant information necessary to apply the PGS to new samples (variant rsID and/or genomic position, weights/effect sizes, effect allele, genome build).</li>
            <li>Information about how the PGS was developed (computational method, variant selection, relevant parameters).</li>
            <li>Descriptions of the samples used to develop the score (e.g. discovery of the variant associations [<i>GWAS samples, which can usually be extracted directly from the GWAS Catalog using GCST IDs</i>], as well as other samples used to develop/train the PGS) and external evaluation.</li>
            <li>Establishment of the PGS' analytic validity, and a description of its predictive performance (e.g. effect sizes [beta, OR, HR, etc.], classification accuracy, proportion of the variance explained (R<sup>2</sup>), and any covariates evaluated in the PGS prediction).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2"><b>An evaluation of a previously developed PGS.</b> This would include the evaluation of PGS already present in the catalog (or eligible for inclusion), on samples not used for PGS development. The requirements for description would be the same as for the evaluation of a new PGS.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A complete description of the data captured for each PGS and publication can be found <a href="/docs/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the pilot PGS Catalog (presented at ASHG 2019) we focused on curating PGS developed after 2010, and included well-studied scores for the following traits: coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes (types 1 and 2), obesity / body mass index (BMI), breast cancer, prostate cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.
        The catalog however is not limited to these traits, and since then we have focused on broadening the coverage of traits and scores. Researchers are invited to <a href="#submission">submit</a> their PGS and evaluations to us by e-mail for curation and inclusion in the PGS Catalog - we plan to provide a streamlined interface to submit these data in the future.

      <h4 id="submission"><i class="fa-solid fa-file-import mr-2 pgs_color_2"></i>Data Submission</h4>
      <p>If you have a PGS or publication that meets the Catalog's eligibility requirements we invite you to submit your data by e-mail (<a href="mailto:{{ pgs_contact }}"><span class="fas fa-envelope pgs_color_1"></span> {{ pgs_contact }}</a>).
          To ensure a speedy curation and inclusion into the catalog it would be helpful if you provide the following information about your study:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2"><b>Source Publication.</b> PubMed identifier and/or publication doi.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <b>The Polygenic Score(s).</b> If you've developed a new PGS we'll need the variant-level information required to calculate the score on new samples (<i>see our <a href="/downloads/#dl_ftp_scoring">Scoring Files documentation</a> for more description</i>).
          If an existing PGS was used it would be helpful if you provided it's PGS ID, or links to the original publication.
